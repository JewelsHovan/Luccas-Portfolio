                    <h2>About Luccas Booth</h2>
                    <p>
                        Luccas Booth's oil paintings represent a collapse of time, memory, and space. They create an unusual atmosphere and dynamic spatial relationship using paints thinned by solvent. The spaces and moments used are curated from his everyday life. Overlapping his personal spaces allows him to condense his life into one moment of time, providing a new perspective on spaces he has grown accustomed to both spatially and mentally.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The process of painting spaces from photography, observation, and memory creates unexpected intersections of line and overlapping mixes of color. The unpredictability of composition, light, and color is what interests Luccas with this process. The overlapping of the imagery is not linear. He allows himself to rework layers at various stages of the painting, pushing backward and pulling forward different layers. This is a way for him to engage with the spatial depth of each space, allowing for many spaces to exist together in a single moment.
